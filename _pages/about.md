Hi! I am Luis Palomino. I am a MS student in Applied & Resource Economics at the [University of Connecticut (UConn)](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include Regional Development, Regional Economics, Spatial Economics, Urban Economics, Economic History, and Human Capital. 

My work combines quantitative analysis, econometric modeling, and machine learning algorithms to generate insights for policy and research. I specialize in data innovation, leveraging satellite imagery, mobile phone data, news, and other unstructured data to create socioeconomic indicators with high spatial and temporal resolution.

My academic experience includes being a Research Specialist at University of Connecticut, Economic Consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank, Research Assistant at the Research Center of Universidad del Pacífico, and Teaching Assistant at Universidad del Pacífico and Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

I hold a MA in Latino and Latin American Studies from University of Connecticut and a Bachelor of Economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.
