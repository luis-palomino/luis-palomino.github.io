Hi! I am Luis Palomino. I am a Peruvian economist and MS student in Applied & Resource Economics at the [University of Connecticut (UConn)](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I also hold an MA in Latino and Latin American Studies from [UConn-El Instituto](https://elin.uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include Regional Development, Regional Economics, Spatial Economics, Urban Economics, Economic History, and Human Capital. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Specialist/Economic Analyst at UConn, an Economic Consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), a Research Assistant at Centro de Investigación de la Universidad del Pacífico (CIUP), and a Teaching Assistant at Universidad del Pacífico (UP) and Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM). My work combines quantitative analysis, econometric modeling, and machine learning algorithms to generate insights for policy and research. I specialize in data innovation, leveraging satellite imagery, mobile phone data, news, and other unstructured data to create socioeconomic indicators with high spatial and temporal resolution.

I aspire to pursue a PhD in Economics or a related field at a program that aligns with my research interests. I aim to build an academic career dedicated to advancing research and contributing to evidence-based policymaking.
